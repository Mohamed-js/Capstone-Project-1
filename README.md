# Capstone Project 1

> Capstone project - Finishing the first module.
This project is a simulation of schools' directory but with another content(a housing one).
I have used industry tools in building this site that is composed of 3 different pages, the main page, the search results page, and the property information page. It is fully responsive to all devices that's why I used flex and grid.
